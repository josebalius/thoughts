# Thoughts Program

I had my site down for a while and have been thinking how to revamp it. I decided to keep it simple and just write my thoughts in a simple way and have it be published on the web.

I wrote a small program in Go that takes a GitHub repo and generates a static website from it. I called it thoughts because well that's what I wanted to do with it and couldn't think of a better name.

The repo is at [https://github.com/josebalius/thoughts](https://github.com/josebalius/thoughts)

This website is at [https://github.com/josebalius/josebalius.com](https://github.com/josebalius/josebalius.com)

I am running it on Fly.io for the moment. I have a few other musings bouncing around my head that I want to write about. Till next time.
